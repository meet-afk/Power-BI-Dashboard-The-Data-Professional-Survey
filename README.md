1.  **Data Loading:** The `Data Professional Survey.csv` was imported into Power BI Desktop.
2.  **Data Transformation (Power Query):** The data was cleaned and preprocessed. Steps included correcting data types, handling null values, splitting columns, and creating conditional columns for better analysis (e.g., salary buckets).
3.  **DAX Measures & Modeling:** Created key DAX measures to calculate averages, counts, and percentages that drive the dashboard's KPIs.
4.  **Dashboard Design:** Designed an intuitive and visually appealing layout with a variety of charts (bar, donut, map, cards) to best represent the data.
5.  **Interactivity:** Implemented slicers and cross-filtering to make the dashboard fully interactive and user-friendly.

## <a name="-conclusion--learnings"></a> üéì Conclusion & Learnings

This project was a fantastic opportunity to practice end-to-end Power BI development, from raw data to a polished, insightful dashboard. It reinforced my skills in data cleaning with Power Query, writing effective DAX measures, and applying data visualization best practices to tell a compelling story. The key takeaway is how a well-designed dashboard can make complex survey data accessible and easy to understand for any audience.
